        <p>With GenKin, you can create an immersive, interactive experience of your family tree in augmented or vitrual reality, complete with your photos, videos, audio files, or text.</p>
        <p>Create a family tree by entering the names of your family members. Upload media for each of your family members.</p>
        <p>When you're done building your tree, view it in augmented reality or virtual reality. With augmented reality, give the site access to your camera to see the tree and your media come to life in the world around you. We recommend this option for mobile users. With virtual reality, view your tree and your media within your computer screen. We recommend this option for desktop users.</p>
        <p>Need inspiration? Check out the gallery to see the trees your fellow users have created.</p>
